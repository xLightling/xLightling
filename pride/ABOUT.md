# Pride SVG

## About

This folder contains a number of pride flags set at 300x180mm in scalable vector graphic format. This arised from my need to have to repeatedly look up flags for any pride-related art projects, most of the time for exact color palettes/etc. Making this a part of my personal repo makes things easier. These are all done manually based off of accepted designs, if applicable; as such there may be slightly incorrect stripe ratios (I will try to calculate them to the best of my ability; for some, if the result of division is an unending decimal, I round; ask to PR if something's off). Some stripes may have rectangle sizes that are larger than what is visible, in order to prevent rendering artifacts (such as a pixel of transparency).
