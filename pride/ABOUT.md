# Pride SVG

This folder contains a number of pride flags set at 300x180mm in scalable vector graphic format. This arised from my need to have to repeatedly look up flags for any pride-related art projects, most of the time for exact color palettes/etc. Making this a part of my personal repo makes things easier. These are all done manually based off of accepted designs, if applicable; as such there may be slightly incorrect stripe ratios (I will try to calculate them to the best of my ability, ask to PR if something's off)

As per the license file, these are of course public domain.
